### Hi there 👋

I am Arpit Dwivedi. My main interest lies in Machine Learning and Computer vision. I also have basic knowledge of Tableau and Docker. I'm no stranger to hard work and my strength is I am flexible with work hours and time bound. I am always curious to learn something new.



- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Computer Vision project.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **best practices for ML** and **Big Data**.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any **AI** or **Web Development** project.

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Docker deployment.

- 💬 Ask me about OpenCV, Tensorflow, chatbots or ML.
